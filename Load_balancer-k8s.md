# Overview of Load Balancers and Kubernetes Design Patterns

## What is a Load Balancer?
A load balancer is a device or software application that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers. 

### Key Functions of a Load Balancer:
1. **Distributes Traffic**: Ensures even traffic distribution among servers.
2. **Ensures Availability and Reliability**: Maintains application uptime.
3. **Improves Performance**: Reduces latency and enhances responsiveness.
4. **Scales Applications**: Handles increased traffic effectively.

### Types of Load Balancers:
1. **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices designed to distribute traffic.
2. **Software Load Balancers**: Applications installed on standard hardware or virtual machines.
3. **Cloud-based Load Balancers**: Integrated into cloud infrastructures, e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer, Google Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer.
4. **Layer 4 Load Balancers (Transport Layer)**: Operate at OSI Layer 4, forwarding traffic based on IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports.
5. **Layer 7 Load Balancers (Application Layer)**: Operate at OSI Layer 7, making decisions based on application-level data.
6. **Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple geographical locations to improve redundancy and global performance.

## Kubernetes Design Patterns
Kubernetes (k8s) design patterns are architectural solutions for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications in Kubernetes.

### Foundational Patterns:
1. **Health Probe Pattern**: Ensures every container implements observable APIs for management.
2. **Predictable Demands Pattern**: Requires declaring application requirements and resource profiles.
3. **Automated Placement Pattern**: Utilizes Kubernetesâ€™ scheduling algorithm for optimal resource allocation.

### Structural Patterns:
4. **Init Container Pattern**: Handles initialization tasks separately from the main application.
5. **Sidecar Pattern**: Extends container functionality without altering the main container.

### Behavioral Patterns:
6. **Batch Job Pattern**: Manages isolated units of work executed as jobs.
7. **Stateful Service Pattern**: Facilitates distributed stateful applications.
8. **Service Discovery Pattern**: Defines how clients discover and interact with services.

### Higher-Level Patterns:
9. **Controller Pattern**: Monitors current state and reconciles it with the desired state.
10. **Operator Pattern**: Automates operational knowledge through algorithms.
